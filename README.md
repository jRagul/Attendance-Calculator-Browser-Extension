# Attendance Helper Browser Extension

A browser extension that scrapes attendance data from your institution's ERP (Educational Resource Planning) system and enhances it by adding a new column. This column calculates and displays the number of classes a student can miss or needs to attend to maintain the minimum attendance threshold of 75%.
**This only works with Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science's ERP.Using it on any other ERP will not produce the expected results**
